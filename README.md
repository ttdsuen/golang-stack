# Stack implementation using Golang's Generics

## Description

Simple stack implementation with slices and generics.

# Setup

At the time of writing, this depends on Golang's generics, which has not been
incorporated in the stable version of Go (1.18). However, it is available
with [gotip](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/dl/gotip).

# Usage

Check out the testing code.
